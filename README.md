# CivUniverse Map

Interactive Map for the [CivUniverse](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivUniverse/) Minecraft server

[Repo for Map Tiles](https://github.com/MadDog443/CUTiles) | [Repo for Json Data](https://maddog443.github.io/CUMap/)

Uses [CivMap](https://github.com/Gjum/CivMap).

# How to [contribute](https://forms.gle/4TrfWZpsNWqDgGKA8) [VoxelMap data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JCmHylPPcv8hZnbHpPd1fEsECfHUhAD6iu5cJiYVb9w/edit#gid=98040205&range=19:19)

> Note that this will contain only the terrain data, and no waypoints.

First of all, quit the server and wait a bit, so the map data files are written to your disk. Now open the map data cache directory:

Windows: go to `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods\VoxelMods\voxelMap\cache`

Mac: go to `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods/VoxelMods/voxelMap/cache`

Then create a .7z, .zip, or .rar archive containing the directory of the server (e.g. play.civuniverse.com), and submit it to my [Google Form](https://forms.gle/4TrfWZpsNWqDgGKA8). If it's a lot of data, you might need to upload it to a file hosting service of your choice (for example PixelDrain or MediaFire) and send it to me via discord @MadDog443#4618.

> Note that all tile data is using the [Liteloader](https://www.liteloader.com/explore/docs/user:install:forge) format.

Done! Thank you for contributing. You will always be remembered.
